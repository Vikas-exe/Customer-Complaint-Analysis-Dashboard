# Customer Complaint Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview

The **Customer Complaint Analysis Dashboard** is a Power BI–based analytical project developed to examine and visualize customer complaint data in order to derive meaningful business insights. The dashboard enables organizations to better understand customer concerns, identify recurring issues, and monitor complaint behavior across multiple dimensions such as product, complaint category, geography, and time.

This project demonstrates the end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from raw data ingestion and cleaning to data modeling and interactive dashboard creation. The goal is to convert unstructured complaint data into structured, actionable insights that support business decision-making and service improvement initiatives.


## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

* To analyze customer complaints and identify the most frequent and critical issues
* To track complaint trends over time and identify patterns or anomalies
* To compare complaint distribution across products, regions, and categories
* To support data-driven decision-making aimed at improving customer satisfaction and operational efficiency


## Dashboard Features

The dashboard includes multiple analytical views and interactive elements:

* Complaint distribution analysis by product and complaint category
* Time-based trend analysis to observe increases or decreases in complaints over specific periods
* Regional analysis to identify locations with higher complaint volumes
* Identification of top complaint issues that require immediate attention
* Interactive slicers and filters to allow users to drill down into specific data segments
* A clean and intuitive visual layout designed for easy interpretation by both technical and non-technical users


## Tools and Technologies Used

* **Power BI** for data visualization and dashboard development
* **Power Query** for data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** for creating calculated measures, KPIs, and aggregations
* **Excel / CSV files** as the source data format


## Data Preparation Process

The data preparation process involved several key steps:

1. Importing raw customer complaint data into Power BI
2. Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent entries
3. Transforming columns into appropriate data types for analysis
4. Creating calculated columns and measures using DAX
5. Establishing relationships between tables where required to enable accurate analysis

## Key Insights

The dashboard helps uncover several important insights, including:

* Products that receive the highest number of customer complaints
* Complaint categories that indicate major service or quality issues
* Monthly or seasonal patterns in complaint volume
* Regions that consistently report higher customer dissatisfaction

These insights can help organizations prioritize corrective actions and improve overall service delivery.
